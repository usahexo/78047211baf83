        <h1 id="What-is-Northern-Boom"><a href="#What-is-Northern-Boom" class="headerlink" title="What is Northern Boom?"></a>What is Northern Boom?</h1><p>Northern Boom is a music production duo from Manchester, England. The two members are producer and songwriter MNEK and singer and songwriter Teddy Sky.</p>
<p>The pair first met in 2009 when they were both students at the Manchester School of Arts. They began working together in early 2013 and released their debut single, “Wrote a Song About You”, in September of that year. The song was a success, reaching number one on the UK R&amp;B charts. </p>
<p>Northern Boom released their debut EP, Northern Lights, in May 2014. The EP debuted at number four on the UK iTunes chart and received positive reviews from music critics. The duo’s second EP, State of Mind, was released in November 2014 and peaked at number three on the iTunes chart. </p>
<p>Northern Boom’s debut studio album, Paradise, was released in June 2015. The album reached number two on the UK iTunes chart and spawned the singles “Paradise”, “Lay Down”, and “All Day Long”. In February 2016, Northern Boom announced that they had split up. </p>
<p>Despite their short-lived tenure as a group, Northern Boom made a significant impact on modern R&amp;B music. Their soulful sound and Teddy Sky’s emotive vocals set them apart from other duos in the industry and paved the way for future artists like Mahalia and Jorja Smith.</p>

<h1 id="What-is-Northern-Boom-Online-Keno"><a href="#What-is-Northern-Boom-Online-Keno" class="headerlink" title="What is Northern Boom Online Keno?"></a>What is Northern Boom Online Keno?</h1><p>Northern Boom Online Keno is nothing like the keno you may have played in a physical casino. This game is played with a computer and a mouse, which gives players much more control over their game. As well, there are a number of bonuses and features that are not available in traditional keno.</p>
<h1 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h1><p>To get started, you first need to choose your bet amount. This can be done by clicking on the up and down arrows next to the bet amount box. Once you have selected your bet amount, click on the “play” button to begin the game. </p>
<p>You will then be shown 20 balls, which will be randomly drawn one at a time. To mark your numbers, simply click on them as they are drawn. If you would like to cancel your selection, simply right-click on the number. When all of the numbers have been selected, Northern Boom will automatically determine if you have won or lost. </p>
<p>If you choose to play again after winning or losing, your bet amount will be automatically reset to the original amount that you selected at the beginning of the game.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-play-Northern-Boom"><a href="#How-to-play-Northern-Boom" class="headerlink" title="How to play Northern Boom?"></a>How to play Northern Boom?</h1><p>Northern Boom is a strategic board game that can be played by two to four players. The aim of the game is to be the first player to get all of their pieces around the board and into their home row.</p>
<p>To play, you will need a game board, four playing pieces of each color, and a set of dice. The game board looks like this:</p>
<p>+———————+ +———————+ | 1 2 3 4 | | 5 6 7 8 | +———————+ +———————+ | 9 10 11 12 | |13 14 15 16| +———————+ +———————+</p>
<p>The players will each put one playing piece in front of them, in the middle of the board. The remaining pieces are placed to one side of the board, within easy reach of all players.</p>
<p>The player who is going first (the youngest player, or the player with the most hair) rolls the dice and moves their piece forward that many spaces on the board. If they roll doubles, they get to move their piece again this turn. If they roll triples, they get to move their piece three times this turn!</p>
<p>When a player’s piece lands on a square occupied by an opponent’s piece, the opponent’s piece is captured and goes back to the player who captured it. When a player’s piece lands on an empty square, they can either claim that square as their new home row, or they can choose to keep moving forward.</p>
<p>If a player cannot move any more pieces because they have no more pieces left or because all of their pieces are blocked by other pieces, then they lose the game. The winner is the first person to get all of their pieces around the board and into their home row.</p>
